This Flutter app allows users to browse and search movies using data from the TVMaze API. 
It includes a Splash Screen with an introductory image, a Home Screen displaying a list of movies with thumbnails, titles, and summaries. 
Tapping on a movie redirects to a Details Screen with more information about the selected movie. A Search Screen with a search bar lets users find specific movies by title. 
The app also features a Bottom Navigation Bar for easy navigation between the Home and Search screens. The UI design is inspired by Netflix, providing a clean, modern, and intuitive experience.
